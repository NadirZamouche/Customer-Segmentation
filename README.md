# Customer Segmentation Project: Unveiling Insights with K-Means Clustering
## Overview
This project focuses on utilizing K-Means clustering to segment customers based on their purchasing behaviors and preferences. By analyzing a comprehensive dataset of customer transactions, we aim to identify distinct segments within the customer base

## ⏳ Dataset
The 'Mall_Customers.csv'  file contains data on various attributes:
- CustomerID
- Gender
- Age
- Annual Income (k$)
- Spending Score (1-100)

## :mag: Data Cleansing
* Removed non-related columns: CustomerID, Age & Gender.
* Ploted heat map for correlation matrix:

Based on the image it seems that there is a very week positive relationship between the 2 columns.
